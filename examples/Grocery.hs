-- A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier charges $7.11. 
-- The kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, and says 
-- "Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them; I'll try again... 
-- Gosh, with adding them the price still comes to $7.11"! What were the prices of 
-- the four items?
